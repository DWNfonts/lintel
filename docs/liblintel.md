# Documents of `liblintel.py` - The Lintel Library.
[< Back](./README.md)

Well I'm not good at making docs. There's a snippet, and hope that will teach you for now. A better docs is coming soon!

```python
lintel = Lintel()
lintel.fromIDS("⿱⿰号官心")
print(lintel.idc)
print(lintel.chars)
print(lintel.notProcessed)
print(str(lintel))
```
