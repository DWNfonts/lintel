# Lintel
[&amp;#20013;&amp;#25991;](./README.zh.md)

Lintel is a software, containing the library and the scripts for reading IDS. Notice that Lintel only supports [BabelStone](https://babelstone.co.uk/CJK/IDS.HTML) flavored IDS, not [Yi Bai's](https://github.com/yi-bai/ids) ~~because I think I'm *tired* about making any scripts for now~~.

The repo is distributed with the BabelStone IDS database, located at `data/IDS.TXT`, and I'll keep it up-to-date.

[Lintel is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD license.](./LICENSE.md)

## What does Lintel mean?

Well lintel means "цег" in Chinese, which I randomly looked up.

Lintel is also a replacement of the hard-read as fuck "Ideographic Description Sequence", or IDS (it's fucking like a constant!)
